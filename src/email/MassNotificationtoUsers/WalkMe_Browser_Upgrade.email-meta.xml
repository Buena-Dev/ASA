    <subject>Action Required: WalkMe Interactive Guidance Tool - Internet Browser Extension Upgrade</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

In preparation for the Salesforce Winter &apos;16 Release, which will dramatically change the user interface of Salesforce, the WalkMe interactive guidance tool requires each user to upgrade the internet browser extension to ensure everything operates as designed.

You are receiving this email because your role in Salesforce has WalkMe enabled.  Even if you don&apos;t currently utilize the WalkMe tool, you should perform this task so that you will be able to use any future WalkMe features we develop.

Starting this week, when you first log into Salesforce you&apos;ll see the following display once a day. REMEMBER: Always use Google Chrome when accessing Salesforce - not Internet Explorer.  Chrome will give you much better results than IE will.

This message will appear after your first log in each day, and will cease to pop up once you have completed the download process.  Simply click on the &quot;Download WalkMe&quot; button on the bottom of the pop up and follow these steps to add the browser extension, as shown below:

&lt;&lt;WalkMe Download Images display the necessary instructions to complete this task.  Please refer to the HTML version of this email for full instructions.&gt;&gt;


Once the extension has been added, you will see the pop up telling you that the WalkMe Extension has been added to Chrome.

Stay tuned for further information regarding the Salesforce Winter &apos;16 release.  The new user interface of the desktop/browser version was unveiled at the Dreamforce conference two weeks ago and the enhanced user experience coming your way is a significant improvement - making it easier to access records, perform updates and navigate throughout the system.

If you have any questions about how to perform the WalkMe download or if you run into any issues, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best regards,
Andrew
