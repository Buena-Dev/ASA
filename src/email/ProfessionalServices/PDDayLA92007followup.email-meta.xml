    <textOnly>Thank you for attending American Student Assistance&apos;s Louisiana Professional Development Day on September 14, 2007.
 
It was a pleasure to see so many friendly faces.
 
I look forward to seeing you at the conference in Shreveport next month. 
To attend another great ASA training, check your conference program for the ASA session &quot;Go With the Flows: Optimizing Your Loan Processing.&quot;
 
Thanks,
Steve
