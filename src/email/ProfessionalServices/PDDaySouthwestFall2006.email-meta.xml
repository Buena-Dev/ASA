Topic Descriptions
 
To Know Me is to Love Me: How Your Personality Impacts Your Team
 
Participants will learn about a tool that can be easily used within their office to create exceptionally performing teams.
The differences between each of us sometimes cause frustration, poor communication, and difficulty coming to agreement.  In this highly interactive session we will explore some of the key factors that cause these differences and the experience of appreciating and capitalizing on them in the workplace.  You will leave this session with tools to identify the differences in those you work with, create processes that utilize the differences and that result in more effective operational methods.  NOTE: this session involves a behavior typing tool, the Keirsey Temperament Sorter.
 
Problem Solved!

This session will help you to identify the problem-solving behaviors you need to solve everyday problems quickly and efficiently.  You will learn which behaviors you need to strengthen and which you need to moderate.
 
This problem solving training introduces a step-by-step and effective approach to problem solving and decision making that has proven to be successful in producing improvements in efficiency, performance, and productivity.
