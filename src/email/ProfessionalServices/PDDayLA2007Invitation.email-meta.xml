Course Descriptions: 
Emotional Intelligence
This workshop takes Emotional Intelligence into the workplace. Business leaders and outstanding performers are not defined by their IQs or even their job skills, but by their &quot;emotional intelligence,” a set of competencies that distinguishes how people manage feelings, interact, and communicate. Analyses done by dozens of experts in 500 corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations worldwide conclude that emotional intelligence is the barometer of excellence on virtually any job. We&apos;ll explain what emotional intelligence is and review its competencies and skills, including control of one&apos;s impulses, self-motivation, empathy, and social competence in interpersonal relationships.
