National FFELP guarantor American Student AssistanceÂ®  has designed a half day event to discuss some of the key concerns of financial aid administrators.  Two of our most requested topics will be covered. 
 
 
Navigating the IRS Tax Return
Join us in this session to learn about tax returns from a financial aid application perspective. What fields you should be looking at? What are some of the common mistakes that families make when completing the financial aid application? This course was created to simplify the verification process. Walk away with a better understanding IRS Tax Returns and the verification process. 
 
Understanding the Millennial Generation and Its Impact on the Admission and Financial Aid Process
If you recruit, retain or serve traditional college-aged students, this training is essential to understanding the newest generation of customers. Through a review of the books Millennials Rising and Millennials Go to College, you will learn how these students are likely to view the admission and aid process and how you can adapt to their unique perspective.
