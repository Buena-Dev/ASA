Greetings to our Salt® Ambassadors and Advisors!

Welcome to the March 2017 Salt Ambassador Program Bulletin, the vehicle that provides you with money tips to share and tools to increase awareness about Salt. Here are things you can do this month to help promote money management and spread the word about Salt.

Plan a Salt Event: April is Financial Literacy Month - Listed below are three financial activities, designed to provide meaningful financial knowledge for students.  Implement one, two or all three during the month of April.
1.       My Two Cents: Sound Financial Advice
2.       What’s in Your Report
3.       My Financial Plan
For detailed information about these events, ask your advisor to login to the Salt Store and download “Salt Activities – April Financial Literacy Month” file listed under Communication Resource.

General Updates

New “My Salt” Experience - “My Salt®” is a new group of features that personalizes saltmoney.org to better meet Salt users’ goals and expectations.
