Go with the Flows: Optimizing Your Loan Processing
Do you ever wonder why you send some certifications go to the lender, some to the guarantor, and some to the servicer? Why do you receive funds from many different institutions while another school receives all of their funds from just one place? What exactly does a guarantor do? What does a lender do? What does a servicer do? This session will bring to light the major FFELP players, as well as the available loan processing flows, including the vocabulary used by everyone involved with those flows. You will also gain a deeper understanding of your current loan processes and new tools to assist you in controlling and streamlining your processing.
 
Lower Your CDR: Cohort Default Management Best Practices
Every year your school receives its Cohort Default Rate from the Department of Education. Some years it goes up, others it goes down. Are there things that you can do that will have a direct impact on that number? Walk away from this session with strategies that you can implement quickly to manage all of your student loan program default rates - and keep them down.
 
High Profile: Increase Financial Aid Office Visibility and Impact on Campus
What is your reputation on campus? Are you interested in making more of an impact on campus and with your students? Hear about strategies to increase the breadth of influence that the Financial Aid Office has on campus. Learn how to better communicate and work more effectively with various departments on your campus and in the community.
