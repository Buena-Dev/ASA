Regulatory Update for Foreign Schools Webex

National FFELP guarantor American Student Assistance® has designed a regulatory update via webex. Join us for an in-depth discussion on the anticipated changes that will result from Negotiated Rulemaking; both the General Provisions and loan issues including changes to preferred lender lists.

Dates and Time:
 
Thursday 10/16/2007  9:00 a.m. - 10:15 a.m. EST 

Course Description: Our regulatory analysts will focus on any changes that we anticipate may impact your day-to-day job responsibilities. Note that this training will be speculative based on the draft language published to date but we want you to be prepared! Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll be offering lots of additional training opportunities once the final rules are out! (ACG/Smart Grants and accreditation will not be covered.)
