    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 

Due to inclement weather American Student Assistance unfortunately has had to cancel our Negotiation Skills event that was scheduled to take place today 
March 27, 2008 at Boise State University.
 
We would like to apologize for any inconvenience this cancellation may have caused.  We hope to reschedule at later date. 
 
Thanks again for your willingness to take time out of your busy schedule to join us; we look forward to seeing you at future events.
 
Sincerely,
