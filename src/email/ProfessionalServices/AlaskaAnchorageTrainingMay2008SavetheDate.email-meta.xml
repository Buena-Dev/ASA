This session will help to clarify the roles of the lender, servicer and guarantor from certification through repayment. 
 
Session Goal(s): 
Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the loan process and which entity is responsible for which activities. This information will enable attendees to better counsel their students on student loan related issues.
