    <textOnly>Subject: ASA&apos;s Spring Training Schedule


ASA’s Training and Development Department is pleased to announce our Spring 2007 course schedule. We have planned our curriculum to assist both the novice financial aid administrator and the seasoned professional. 

•	Student Retention — What’s the Big Deal? Institutions are realizing that while recruiting the “right” students is important, providing support to encourage their success is crucial. In this session we’ll discuss the costs of attrition for both the institution as well as the student.
•	Cash Management Rules and Regulations- We&apos;ll review the regulations regarding funding disbursements, posting requirements to student accounts, and timeframes for returning funds. 
•	An Introduction to FFELP - Whether you&apos;re new to the industry or just need a refresher on the basics of FFELP, this session is for you. We&apos;ll cover the life of a FFELP loan from the application process through final repayment.
