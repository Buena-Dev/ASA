Greetings to our Salt® Ambassadors and Advisors!


Welcome to the December/January 2016 Salt Ambassador Program Bulletin, the vehicle that provides you with money tips to share and tools to increase awareness about Salt. Here are things you can do this month to help promote money management and spread the word about Salt. Share the suggestions below through your school and personal social media channels.
