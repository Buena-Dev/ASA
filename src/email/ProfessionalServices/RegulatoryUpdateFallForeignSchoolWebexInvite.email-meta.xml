A quick first glimpse of some of the changes drafted into the Higher Education Act Reauthorization Bill. We will review Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HR 4137) as passed into law on August 14, 2008. While it&apos;s early in the game to discuss details and implementation, this session can give you a head start on knowing what to expect. You will also have the opportunity to have your questions answered.
