Understanding the Millennial Generation and their Impact on Campus
Throughout the course of this workshop, we will provide you with the necessary tools for bridging the communication gap between your office and the high population of millennial students in academia today. We will also discuss specific tools to assist you in dealing with “helicopter parents” who are often intimately involved in the financial aid decision-making process with these students. In addition, we will explore the new expectations your students have when communicating with your office by mail, telephone, or e-mail.
 
Where is it Written?
Update your Title IV regulation and process research skills; learn to navigate the Internet effectively for the most up-to-date FFELP information and resources, such as the Common Manual, Federal Registers, and useful websites; increase your problem solving skills; and discover useful industry tools for administering Title IV. You&apos;ll also find out how a proposed regulation becomes law.
 
Who Should Attend 

Any financial aid administrator that is interested in understanding the millennial student  and how to access financial aid resources.
