    <subject>Information regarding Lender of Last Resort provided by American Student Assistance</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Financial Aid Administrator,

Recent challenges in the capital markets, coupled with 
reductions in the lender yield under the Federal Family 
Education Loan Program (FFELP) have caused a number of 
lenders to withdraw or restrict their participation in the 
program and have created concern among schools, parents, 
and students about the availability of funds for the 
upcoming academic year. American Student Assistance® 
(ASA) is confident that borrowers will continue to have 
access to FFELP and we are committed to working with our 
school and lender clients to ensure that borrowers receive 
the loan funds they need to achieve their educational 
goals. 

In cooperation with the Secretary of Education, ASA 
recently reviewed and updated our Lender of Last Resort 
(LLR) procedures. As the designated guarantor for 
Massachusetts and D.C., we wanted to provide you with our 
procedures to assure you that in the event that LLR 
becomes necessary, FFELP loans will be available and 
delivered in a timely and efficient manner. 

Under prior regulations, LLR was established as a borrower- 
driven program. H.R. 5715, which was signed into law by 
President Bush on May 7, authorized the Secretary to 
administer the program on a school level in some cases. 
Guidelines for how this process will work will be 
forthcoming from the Department of Education (ED) and we 
will provide more information to you as it becomes 
available. In the meantime, we have established our 
procedures to ensure individual borrowers have access to 
LLR. 

ASA&apos;s LLR process is intended to be as simple and 
straightforward as possible. As the trusted agent, your 
office would likely be the first point of contact for an 
individual borrower who was denied a conventional loan. 
If you are unable to find a lender willing to provide 
FFELP funding to that borrower, you are encouraged to 
contact ASA. We may be able to assist you in locating a 
conventional lender prior to assisting you with the LLR 
program. 

If LLR is necessary for a borrower, the documents below 
should be packaged together and forwarded to ASA all at 
once to ensure efficient processing: 
• An original Master Promissory Note (MPN) with 
ASA&apos;s LLR code, completed in full by each borrower. ASA&apos;s 
LLR code will be distributed as needed once the code is 
approved by ED. 
• An original School Certification Form completed by 
the school&apos;s financial aid administrator. 
• The attached LLR Cover Sheet, which can be used 
for individual borrowers and groups of borrowers. The 
cover sheet represents the school verification that the 
borrower(s) was/were denied by at least one lender for a 
conventional loan and that the school has maintained the 
denial documentation. 

Once ASA receives the completed documents, the loan(s) 
will be scheduled for disbursement. As a general rule, if 
all documents are complete and the preferred disbursement 
dates are not set in the future, the loan(s) could be 
disbursed in as few as two, but no more than eight 
business days, depending on the school&apos;s disbursement 
schedule. Upon approval, the borrower will then receive 
the notice of guarantee and disclosure and the loan will 
follow the typical &apos;life of the loan&apos; process.

Please refer to the frequently Asked Questions below which 
may answer some of your specific questions about LLR. If 
you have additional questions or concerns, please contact 
me or ASA&apos;s Call Center at customerservice@amsa.com or at

-FAQ- 

Q. Does ASA think Lender of Last Resort (LLR) will be 
necessary? 
A. For the majority of schools—No. There are still lenders 
committed to the Federal Family Education Loan Program 
(FFELP) that will be willing to offer conventional loans. 
The profile of a school that may have difficulty finding a 
lender willing to offer conventional FFELP loans to their 
borrowers is a school with a relatively low graduation 
rate, high withdrawal rate, high cohort default rate, 
and/or low balance loans. Most schools in Massachusetts 
and D.C., ASA’s designated states, do not fit that profile. 

Q: What is LLR? 
A: LLR is a guarantor or lender that agrees to make 
Stafford or PLUS loans (both graduate and parent) to 
borrowers who are eligible under the program guidelines, 
but have been denied a conventional loan by at least one 
lender. Generally the guarantor is the LLR for its 
designated state(s); ASA is the LLR for Massachusetts and 
D.C. 

Q: Where can schools find more information about LLR from 
the Department of Education (ED)? 
A. Schools can find more information about LLR at the 
links below: 
• April 
http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN0803.html 
• May 
http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/050508GEN0805.html 

Q: What is the minimum LLR loan amount that can be 
approved? 
A: The minimum LLR loan amount that ASA will authorize is 
$200. 

Q: What are the terms of a LLR loan? 
A: For borrowers, the loans that they borrow under LLR 
have the same fees, terms, and conditions that a 
conventional Stafford or PLUS loan has. For the lender, 
the loans originated under LLR have same terms and 
conditions that a conventional Stafford or PLUS loan has 
except the loans are insured against default at 100% 
rather than the regular 97%. 

School Eligibility 

Q: Are all schools eligible to participate in LLR with ASA? 
A: A school can receive a LLR loan from ASA if the school 
is: 
• Located in either Massachusetts or D.C. 
• An eligible institution as determined by ED, with an 
approved Program Participation Agreement (PPA) 
• Unable to find a lender willing to make conventional 
FFELP loans to otherwise eligible borrowers 

Q: If schools have campuses in different states, how do 
they decide which guarantor to use for LLR? 
A: The designated guarantor for the state in which each 
campus is located must make LLR loans to any borrower 
attending the school in the designated state and any 
resident of the state attending a school in another state.

School Process 

Q: What documents must schools provide ASA in order for a 
LLR loan to be approved? 
A: If LLR is necessary for a borrower, the documents below 
should be packaged together and forwarded to ASA all at 
once to ensure efficient processing: 
• An original Master Promissory Note (MPN) with ASA’s LLR 
code, completed in full by each borrower. ASA’s LLR code 
will be distributed as needed once the code is approved by 
ED. 
• An original School Certification Form completed by the 
school’s financial aid administrator. 
• The attached LLR Cover Sheet, which can be used for 
individual borrowers and groups of borrowers. The cover 
sheet represents the school verification that the borrower 
(s) was/were denied by at least one lender for a 
conventional loan and that the school has maintained the 
denial documentation. Note: Schools cannot require that 
students be denied by more than two lenders. 

Q. Where do schools send the completed LLR paperwork? 
A. The mailing address for the LLR documents is: 
American Student Assistance 
Attention: Document Processing 
PO BOX 55152 
Boston, MA 02205-8057 

Q. Instead of doing individual approvals outlined in the 
process above, can schools become a designated LLR school? 
A. Under prior regulations, LLR was established as a 
borrower-driven program. H.R. 5715, which was signed into 
law by President Bush on May 7, authorized the Secretary 
to administer the program on a school level in some cases. 
Guidelines for how this process will work will be 
forthcoming from ED and we will provide more information 
as it becomes available. In the meantime, we have 
established our procedures to ensure individual borrowers 
have access to LLR. 

Q. If a school becomes a designated LLR school, is the 
school still required to submit the cover sheet with 
individual borrowers or groups of borrowers? 
A. No, if a school becomes a designated LLR school by ED, 
the cover sheet would not be needed. 

Q. Do schools need to keep copies of the denial letters 
that borrowers provide them? 
A. Yes, schools need to maintain the denial records in 
students’ files under the normal record retention 
requirements. 

Q. What is ASA’s LLR code? 
A. ASA will distribute the code as necessary when the code 
is approved by ED. 

Q: Once all of the required documents are provided, when 
can schools expect to receive a disbursement? 
A. Once ASA receives the completed documents, the loan(s) 
will be scheduled for disbursement. As a general rule, if 
all documents are complete and the preferred disbursement 
dates are not set in the future, the loan(s) could be 
disbursed in as few as two, but no more than eight 
business days, depending on the school’s disbursement 
schedule. 

Q: Does ASA have an electronic process for approving LLR 
loans? 
A: ASA will have an electronic process in place in the 
coming months. We will provide more information to you 
when it becomes available. 
Think About Tomorrow® 
Q: Does ASA have LLR MPNs or other collateral that schools 
can use to facilitate the LLR process? 
A: ASA will have LLR packets available once our LLR code 
has been approved. The packets will contain debt 
management information as well as a MPN with ASA’s LLR 
code pre-printed. We will contact schools when this 
information is available and also make it accessible via 
our website. 

School Resources 

Q: Who can schools call with questions? 
A: If schools have any questions or concerns, they should 
contact their client manager or ASA’s Call Center at 
customerservice@amsa.com or 800.999.9080 and select Option 
1. The Call Center’s normal hours of operation are Monday 
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET. 

Borrower Eligibility 

Q: How does a borrower become eligible for a LLR loan at 
ASA? 
A: An otherwise eligible FFELP borrower becomes eligible 
for an LLR loan by being denied a conventional loan by at 
least one lender. PLUS borrowers rejected for credit 
reasons only are not considered eligible for an LLR loan. 
In addition, the borrower must be a resident of or be 
attending a school in either Massachusetts or D.C. 

Borrower Process 

Q: What is the LLR process at ASA for a borrower? 
A: A borrower who has attempted to obtain a conventional 
FFELP loan and has been denied will be referred to their 
school for assistance. The school may be able to assist 
the borrower in finding a conventional loan before 
proceeding with LLR. The borrower must supply the school 
with a copy of the denial (either email or letter). The 
borrower must also complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) 
with ASA’s LLR code. The school will then provide ASA with 
the borrower’s completed MPN, a School Certification Form, 
and ASA’s LLR Cover Sheet, verifying that the borrower has 
been denied a conventional FFELP loan and that the school 
has maintained the denial documentation. The borrower will 
receive a notice of guarantee and disclosure and the loan 
will be disbursed according to the school’s disbursement 
schedule. 

Borrower Resources 

Q: How will borrowers be counseled if they contact ASA 
about a LLR loan? 
A: Under the current process, borrowers who contact ASA 
after being denied a conventional FFELP loan through a 
lender will be referred to their school for assistance. 
The school may be able to assist borrowers in finding a 
lender willing to offer a conventional loan before 
initiating LLR.
