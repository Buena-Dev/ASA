<![CDATA[<P>Dear Financial Aid Administrator,<BR><BR>Recent challenges in the capital markets, coupled with <BR>reductions in the lender yield under the Federal Family <BR>Education Loan Program (FFELP) have caused a number of <BR>lenders to withdraw or restrict their participation in the <BR>program and have created concern among schools, parents, <BR>and students about the availability of funds for the <BR>upcoming academic year. American Student Assistance® <BR>(ASA) is confident that borrowers will continue to have <BR>access to FFELP and we are committed to working with our <BR>school and lender clients to ensure that borrowers receive <BR>the loan funds they need to achieve their educational <BR>goals. <BR><BR>In cooperation with the Secretary of Education, ASA <BR>recently reviewed and updated our Lender of Last Resort <BR>(LLR) procedures. As the designated guarantor for <BR>Massachusetts and D.C., we wanted to provide you with our <BR>procedures to assure you that in the event that LLR <BR>becomes necessary, FFELP loans will be available and <BR>delivered in a timely and efficient manner. <BR><BR>Under prior regulations, LLR was established as a borrower- <BR>driven program. H.R. 5715, which was signed into law by <BR>President Bush on May 7, authorized the Secretary to <BR>administer the program on a school level in some cases. <BR>Guidelines for how this process will work will be <BR>forthcoming from the Department of Education (ED) and we <BR>will provide more information to you as it becomes <BR>available. In the meantime, we have established our <BR>procedures to ensure individual borrowers have access to <BR>LLR. <BR><BR>ASA's LLR process is intended to be as simple and <BR>straightforward as possible. As the trusted agent, your <BR>office would likely be the first point of contact for an <BR>individual borrower who was denied a conventional loan. <BR>If you are unable to find a lender willing to provide <BR>FFELP funding to that borrower, you are encouraged to <BR>contact ASA. We may be able to assist you in locating a <BR>conventional lender prior to assisting you with the LLR <BR>program. <BR><BR>If LLR is necessary for a borrower, the documents below <BR>should be packaged together and forwarded to ASA all at <BR>once to ensure efficient processing: <BR>• An original Master Promissory Note (MPN) with <BR>ASA's LLR code, completed in full by each borrower. ASA's <BR>LLR code will be distributed as needed once the code is <BR>approved by ED. <BR>• An original School Certification Form completed by <BR>the school's financial aid administrator. <BR>• The attached LLR Cover Sheet, which can be used <BR>for individual borrowers and groups of borrowers. The <BR>cover sheet represents the school verification that the <BR>borrower(s) was/were denied by at least one lender for a <BR>conventional loan and that the school has maintained the <BR>denial documentation. <BR><BR>Once ASA receives the completed documents, the loan(s) <BR>will be scheduled for disbursement. As a general rule, if <BR>all documents are complete and the preferred disbursement <BR>dates are not set in the future, the loan(s) could be <BR>disbursed in as few as two, but no more than eight <BR>business days, depending on the school's disbursement <BR>schedule. Upon approval, the borrower will then receive <BR>the notice of guarantee and disclosure and the loan will <BR>follow the typical 'life of the loan' process. <BR><BR>More information about LLR is available at the links <BR>below: <BR>• April <BR><A href="http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN0803.html" target=_BLANK><FONT color=#3333ff>http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN0803.html</FONT></A><FONT color=#3366ff><FONT color=#3333ff> </FONT><BR></FONT><BR>• May <BR><A href="http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/050508GEN0805.html" target=_BLANK><FONT color=#3333ff>http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/050508GEN0805.html</FONT></A><FONT color=#3333ff> </FONT><BR><BR>Please refer to the frequently Asked Questions below which <BR>may answer some of your specific questions about LLR. If <BR>you have additional questions or concerns, please contact <BR>me or ASA's Call Center at <A href="mailto:customerservice@amsa.com"><FONT color=#3333ff>customerservice@amsa.com</FONT></A><FONT color=#3333ff> </FONT>or at <BR>800.999.9080 and select Option 1. <BR><BR><BR>-FAQ- <BR><BR>Q. Does ASA think Lender of Last Resort (LLR) will be <BR>necessary? <BR>A. For the majority of schools—No. There are still lenders <BR>committed to the Federal Family Education Loan Program <BR>(FFELP) that will be willing to offer conventional loans. <BR>The profile of a school that may have difficulty finding a <BR>lender willing to offer conventional FFELP loans to their <BR>borrowers is a school with a relatively low graduation <BR>rate, high withdrawal rate, high cohort default rate, <BR>and/or low balance loans. Most schools in Massachusetts <BR>and D.C., ASA’s designated states, do not fit that profile. <BR><BR>Q: What is LLR? <BR>A: LLR is a guarantor or lender that agrees to make <BR>Stafford or PLUS loans (both graduate and parent) to <BR>borrowers who are eligible under the program guidelines, <BR>but have been denied a conventional loan by at least one <BR>lender. Generally the guarantor is the LLR for its <BR>designated state(s); ASA is the LLR for Massachusetts and <BR>D.C. <BR><BR>Q: Where can schools find more information about LLR from <BR>the Department of Education (ED)? <BR>A. Schools can find more information about LLR at the <BR>links below: <BR>• April <BR><A href="http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN0803.html" target=_BLANK><FONT color=#3333ff>http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN0803.html</FONT></A><FONT color=#3333ff> </FONT><BR>• May <BR><A href="http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/050508GEN0805.html" target=_BLANK><FONT color=#3333ff>http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/050508GEN0805.html</FONT></A><FONT color=#3333ff> <BR></FONT><BR>Q: What is the minimum LLR loan amount that can be <BR>approved? <BR>A: The minimum LLR loan amount that ASA will authorize is <BR>$200. <BR><BR>Q: What are the terms of a LLR loan? <BR>A: For borrowers, the loans that they borrow under LLR <BR>have the same fees, terms, and conditions that a <BR>conventional Stafford or PLUS loan has. For the lender, <BR>the loans originated under LLR have same terms and <BR>conditions that a conventional Stafford or PLUS loan has <BR>except the loans are insured against default at 100% <BR>rather than the regular 97%. <BR><BR>School Eligibility <BR><BR>Q: Are all schools eligible to participate in LLR with ASA? <BR>A: A school can receive a LLR loan from ASA if the school <BR>is: <BR>• Located in either Massachusetts or D.C. <BR>• An eligible institution as determined by ED, with an <BR>approved Program Participation Agreement (PPA) <BR>• Unable to find a lender willing to make conventional <BR>FFELP loans to otherwise eligible borrowers <BR><BR>Q: If schools have campuses in different states, how do <BR>they decide which guarantor to use for LLR? <BR>A: The designated guarantor for the state in which each <BR>campus is located must make LLR loans to any borrower <BR>attending the school in the designated state and any <BR>resident of the state attending a school in another state. <BR>Think About Tomorrow® <BR><A href="http://www.amsa.com" target=_BLANK><FONT color=#3333ff>www.amsa.com</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;<BR></FONT>School Process <BR><BR>Q: What documents must schools provide ASA in order for a <BR>LLR loan to be approved? <BR>A: If LLR is necessary for a borrower, the documents below <BR>should be packaged together and forwarded to ASA all at <BR>once to ensure efficient processing: <BR>• An original Master Promissory Note (MPN) with ASA’s LLR <BR>code, completed in full by each borrower. ASA’s LLR code <BR>will be distributed as needed once the code is approved by <BR>ED. <BR>• An original School Certification Form completed by the <BR>school’s financial aid administrator. <BR>• The attached LLR Cover Sheet, which can be used for <BR>individual borrowers and groups of borrowers. The cover <BR>sheet represents the school verification that the borrower <BR>(s) was/were denied by at least one lender for a <BR>conventional loan and that the school has maintained the <BR>denial documentation. Note: Schools cannot require that <BR>students be denied by more than two lenders. <BR><BR>Q. Where do schools send the completed LLR paperwork? <BR>A. The mailing address for the LLR documents is: <BR>American Student Assistance <BR>Attention: Document Processing <BR>PO BOX 55152 <BR>Boston, MA 02205-8057 <BR><BR>Q. Instead of doing individual approvals outlined in the <BR>process above, can schools become a designated LLR school? <BR>A. Under prior regulations, LLR was established as a <BR>borrower-driven program. H.R. 5715, which was signed into <BR>law by President Bush on May 7, authorized the Secretary <BR>to administer the program on a school level in some cases. <BR>Guidelines for how this process will work will be <BR>forthcoming from ED and we will provide more information <BR>as it becomes available. In the meantime, we have <BR>established our procedures to ensure individual borrowers <BR>have access to LLR. <BR><BR>Q. If a school becomes a designated LLR school, is the <BR>school still required to submit the cover sheet with <BR>individual borrowers or groups of borrowers? <BR>A. No, if a school becomes a designated LLR school by ED, <BR>the cover sheet would not be needed. <BR><BR>Q. Do schools need to keep copies of the denial letters <BR>that borrowers provide them? <BR>A. Yes, schools need to maintain the denial records in <BR>students’ files under the normal record retention <BR>requirements. <BR><BR>Q. What is ASA’s LLR code? <BR>A. ASA will distribute the code as necessary when the code <BR>is approved by ED. <BR><BR>Q: Once all of the required documents are provided, when <BR>can schools expect to receive a disbursement? <BR>A. Once ASA receives the completed documents, the loan(s) <BR>will be scheduled for disbursement. As a general rule, if <BR>all documents are complete and the preferred disbursement <BR>dates are not set in the future, the loan(s) could be <BR>disbursed in as few as two, but no more than eight <BR>business days, depending on the school’s disbursement <BR>schedule. <BR><BR>Q: Does ASA have an electronic process for approving LLR <BR>loans? <BR>A: ASA will have an electronic process in place in the <BR>coming months. We will provide more information to you <BR>when it becomes available. <BR>Think About Tomorrow® <BR>Q: Does ASA have LLR MPNs or other collateral that schools <BR>can use to facilitate the LLR process? <BR>A: ASA will have LLR packets available once our LLR code <BR>has been approved. The packets will contain debt <BR>management information as well as a MPN with ASA’s LLR <BR>code pre-printed. We will contact schools when this <BR>information is available and also make it accessible via <BR>our website. <BR><BR>School Resources <BR><BR>Q: Who can schools call with questions? <BR>A: If schools have any questions or concerns, they should <BR>contact their client manager or ASA’s Call Center at <BR><A href="mailto:customerservice@amsa.com"><FONT color=#3333ff>customerservice@amsa.com</FONT></A> or 800.999.9080 and select Option <BR>1. The Call Center’s normal hours of operation are Monday <BR>through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET. <BR><BR>Borrower Eligibility <BR><BR>Q: How does a borrower become eligible for a LLR loan at <BR>ASA? <BR>A: An otherwise eligible FFELP borrower becomes eligible <BR>for an LLR loan by being denied a conventional loan by at <BR>least one lender. PLUS borrowers rejected for credit <BR>reasons only are not considered eligible for an LLR loan. <BR>In addition, the borrower must be a resident of or be <BR>attending a school in either Massachusetts or D.C. <BR><BR>Borrower Process <BR><BR>Q: What is the LLR process at ASA for a borrower? <BR>A: A borrower who has attempted to obtain a conventional <BR>FFELP loan and has been denied will be referred to their <BR>school for assistance. The school may be able to assist <BR>the borrower in finding a conventional loan before <BR>proceeding with LLR. The borrower must supply the school <BR>with a copy of the denial (either email or letter). The <BR>borrower must also complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) <BR>with ASA’s LLR code. The school will then provide ASA with <BR>the borrower’s completed MPN, a School Certification Form, <BR>and ASA’s LLR Cover Sheet, verifying that the borrower has <BR>been denied a conventional FFELP loan and that the school <BR>has maintained the denial documentation. The borrower will <BR>receive a notice of guarantee and disclosure and the loan <BR>will be disbursed according to the school’s disbursement <BR>schedule. <BR><BR>Borrower Resources <BR><BR>Q: How will borrowers be counseled if they contact ASA <BR>about a LLR loan? <BR>A: Under the current process, borrowers who contact ASA <BR>after being denied a conventional FFELP loan through a <BR>lender will be referred to their school for assistance. <BR>The school may be able to assist borrowers in finding a <BR>lender willing to offer a conventional loan before <BR>initiating LLR. <BR><BR>Please direct any additional questions and or concerns to <BR>me or ASA's Call Center at <A href="mailto:customerservice@amsa.com"><FONT color=#3333ff>customerservice@amsa.com</FONT></A><FONT color=#3333ff> </FONT>or at <BR>800.999.9080 and select Option 1.</P>
