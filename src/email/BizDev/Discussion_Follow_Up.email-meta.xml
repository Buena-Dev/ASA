    <subject>{!Contact.FirstName}, Thanks for talking to me about SALT!</subject>
    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.FirstName},

As a follow up to our discussion yesterday, you can create a SALT account and access the full on-line experience by visiting https://www.saltmoney.org and using ASA University as your school affiliation. This will give you the opportunity to navigate the site and take an in-depth look at our content and curriculum.

In addition, I wanted to share links for our SALT blog, Twitter and Facebook page. The blog is a great resource and it displays our approach to deliver useful information in a relate able tone. We have a diverse group of knowledgeable contributors including students and recent graduates.

SALT Blog: http://blog.saltmoney.org/
Twitter: https://twitter.com/SALT_MONEY

Also, we&apos;ve recently created a video that introduces the SALT program and more specifically provides a guided tour of the platform. {!Contact.FirstName}, this could be useful as you look to introduce our efforts to folks on your team and then, we may consider including this in a member communication about our partnership. The link is below.

If you have any questions as you peruse the site, please pass them my way.
