Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
We would like to remind you that ASAâ€™s 2008 Customer Satisfaction Survey will only be available until Friday, October 24.  
 
Please, take a few moments to tell us what you think about the customer service you received from our new group, Strategic Lender Services.  Our job is to make sure your experience with ASA is positive and that you are receiving relevant, up-to-date information from ASA.  
 
Your feedback is extremely valuable to us and will help us enhance our services to you.  Please let us know if you have any recommendations or requests for how ASA can better meet your needs.
