<![CDATA[<P><BR>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</P>
<P>On behalf of American Student Assistance, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend the&nbsp;NYSFAAA Region 4 &amp; 5 Novice Training Event.&nbsp; Now that you’ve returned to the office, you’re probably thinking about ways you can make the upcoming year less stressful for your students and your staff.&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to tell you how we can assist you in that goal.&nbsp; </P>
<P>American Student Assistance has developed a comprehensive series of trainings and workshops on topics that matter most to the financial aid professional.&nbsp; We’ve designed our trainings with your needs in mind.&nbsp; All ASA trainings are offered free of charge to schools and partners because we know that budgets are tight.&nbsp; ASA courses are perfect for state association events, staff retreats, and office planning days.&nbsp; We can also design customized trainings to meet your institution’s specific needs.</P>
<P>If you are interested in learning more about ASA or would like to schedule an individual training at your institution, we invite you to view our website at <A href="http://www.amsa.com">www.amsa.com</A> or feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.&nbsp; I look forward to speaking with you soon.</P>
<P>Sincerely,<BR><BR>{!Contact.OwnerFullName}<BR>{!Contact.OwnerTitle}<BR>{!Contact.OwnerPhone}<BR>American Student Assistance<BR><BR></P>]]></td>
