From the Desk of Bill Fortier


Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 









  

ASA is proud to announce that new additions and enhancements to the lender portion of our website (www.amsa.com/lenders/index) are now live.  
 
The Strategic Lender Services team has revised these webpages to focus on your needs as ASA’s valued lender partners. The webpages include details about our Wellness services, training sessions, and your personal customer service contacts. We’re also excited to announce that all previous issues of The Partnership Exchange, ASA’s lender-focused quarterly newsletter, are now available in PDF format online. 
 
 Remember to check our website often, as we will be updating it frequently, and be sure to visit The Partnership Exchange webpage in January when we will be publishing the newsletter’s winter 2010 edition.
 
We hope that this revised portion of our website will be a valuable resource for you. Please feel free to contact us with any question, concerns, or additional information you would like to see online.  
 

Thank you; we hope you have a happy holiday.  
 
Bill Fortier
