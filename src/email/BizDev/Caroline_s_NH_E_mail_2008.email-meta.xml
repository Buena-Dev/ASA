    <subject>ASA Is Proud to Be a Sponsor of NHASFAA</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
American Student Assistance® (ASA) is excited to attend and help sponsor NHASFAA. We would like to remind you not to miss our interactive sessions “SAP Doesn’t Just Come From Trees” and “Everything I Know About Leadership I Learned From the Movies” being led by Bradley Finger, one of ASA’s external training specialists. Also, remember to stop by our booth to talk with our representatives—including our newest associate, Jeff Bentley—about how ASA can help you succeed. 
 
Jeff will be joining our new team of New England regional account executives as a dedicated resource for New Hampshire educational institutions. Jeff began his career in higher education working in a financial aid office. He started at ASA 6 years ago as a member of our school client management team before transitioning internally to our lender/servicer relations group. These experiences have provided Jeff with a well-rounded view of the industry and given him the opportunity to address schools’ needs as families look to finance their education.
 
Jeff will be joined at our booth by Caroline Menendez, the manager of our New England team. Stop by to say hello to them—and to learn how ASA can act as a trusted agent for your schools and borrowers.
