    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

To follow up on our earlier conversation, here is some information about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

To have your loans forgiven under PSLF, you must work full time in a qualifying public service job for 10 years and make qualifying payments the entire time. Qualifying payments are those made at or above the standard (10-year) payment amount or those made under an income-driven repayment plan.

Not all loans and not all jobs are eligible for this program, so be sure to review the complete list of rules at the Department of Education aid website, studentaid.ed.gov.
If you have any other questions, you can email us at AskASA@asa.org. 

Thank you,

American Student Assistance
