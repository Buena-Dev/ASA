    <subject>ASA&apos;s Customer Satisfaction Survey Launches October 5!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
At American Student Assistance® (ASA), we take pride in providing our clients with outstanding customer service.  Each fall we ask you to evaluate the customer service you receive in order to help us make improvements to our service.  Your feedback is extremely valuable to us and has assisted us in enhancing our service delivery and recognizing successes.
 
The survey will be e-mailed to you on Monday, October 5, 2009. You will have the opportunity to evaluate not only client managers and client service associates but regional account executives you have working relationships with as well.  
 
Thank you in advance for participating in this survey as we understand that there are many conflicting demands on your time. Please feel free to contact me personally if you have questions or feedback regarding this process.
 
Sincerely,
 
Susan Nathan
Vice President of Lender and School Services
