    <subject>Melior Survey - U.S. Bank account follow-up question</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},
  
I wanted to thank you for taking time to complete the Melior Group Survey this past June.  It has come to our attention that there may have been some confusion around one of the questions and we would like to clarify.
 
Question #11 asked if your university currently has a U.S. Bank account.  We want to define what was meant by U.S. Bank account.
 
This question was intended to determine if your university currently has an account set up with a bank that is physically located in the U.S. and not a bank account for your U.S. students (located in your specific country).
 
If you had previously answered YES to this question (where you indicated that your university has a U.S. Bank account) and you would like to change your answer to NO, or if you need additional clarification, please email me directly at cmenendez@amsa.com.
 
 
Thank you,
 
Caroline Menendez
