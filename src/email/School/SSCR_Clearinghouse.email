Dear Colleague,

I am contacting you today because your school should have received the Student Status Confirmation Report (SSCR) from ASA via the U.S. postal service.  We have received confirmation from National Student Clearinghouse that your institution reports enrollment via Clearinghouse On-line Reporting Application (CORA).  We will update your institution profile accordingly so you may discard (shred) the SSCR you received.

Our apologies for the inconvenience.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

Many thanks, 
Ann
