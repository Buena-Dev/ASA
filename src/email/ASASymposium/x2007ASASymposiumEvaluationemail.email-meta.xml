    <textOnly>Dear Colleague:
 
Thank you for attending the 2007 American Student Assistance® Symposium:  Continuing the Conversation on Student Debt:  Moving from Policy to Practice. The speakers, the attendees’ enthusiasm and active participation combined to make this Symposium a memorable learning experience.  
 
Now that the 2007 Symposium is history, it’s time for us to start thinking about next year’s event – and how we can make it even better.  We want to hear from you.  Please take a moment to tell us what you thought about this year’s Symposium.  Your feedback is valuable to us.  The online evaluation  http://www.keysurvey.com/survey/158072/19f8/ takes about 5 minutes to complete and will be available through Monday, July 2, 2007.  You can also forward any comments and suggestions to your ASA representative.
 
Also, please check www.amsa.com in the coming days for our Symposium Wrap-Up.  We will be posting session handouts, as well as audio recordings of several sessions.  
 
Again, thank you for joining us this year and we look forward to seeing you next year.
 
Sincerely,
 
American Student Assistance</textOnly>
