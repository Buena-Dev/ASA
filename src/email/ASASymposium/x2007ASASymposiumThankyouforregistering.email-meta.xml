    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
We have assembled a wonderful program for the ASA 2007 Symposium and are excited that you will be joining us.
 
Here’s information that will make your visit easier – and more fun.
 
This year’s Symposium will be held at two new adjoining sites, The Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center EAST (BCEC), on June 17 – 19, 2007.
 
If you arrive on Sunday, June 17, be sure to join us for early registration and an informal kick-off reception in The Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel on the lower level – look for ASA greeters in orange shirts and signs to direct you.
 
Monday and Tuesday, June 18 and 19, all Symposium sessions will take place in The BCEC EAST, which is accessible from The Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel via the walkway on the second level. Again, our greeters and signs will direct you.
 
On Monday evening, you are invited to a traditional New England clambake on the Moakley U.S. Courthouse lawn at Fan Pier – with its amazing views of Boston. Trolleys will depart from the Westin starting at 6:00 p.m. and return to the hotel beginning at 8:30 p.m.  Attire for this event will be casual.
 
§                If you’re driving to the Symposium, you’ll find directions below that will help you get to the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel, located at 425 Summer Street – look for ASA staff in orange shirts and signs along the streets heading toward the Westin to show you the way.
o       Parking – we recommend parking in The Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel garage rather than the Center’s garage. ASA staff in orange shirts and signs will direct you to the Westin valet or self-parking. Please note that the Symposium is located in the BCEC EAST in the area closest to the Westin walkway.
                        Parking cost:  All day, 24-hour self parking: $29
                                              24-hour valet with in-and-out privileges: $39
