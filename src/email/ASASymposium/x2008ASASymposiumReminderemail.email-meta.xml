    <textOnly>Greetings!
 
American Student Assistance® (ASA) invites you to join us at our 23rd annual Symposium June 16-17 at the Boston Convention &amp; Exhibition Center and Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts. 
 
The ASA Symposium attracts national and international higher education decision makers and provides opportunities for you to exchange ideas with colleagues, network with experts in various fields, and catch up on the latest industry buzz. The theme of this year&apos;s 2-day event is Building Futures—Measuring Success.
 
Each year we strive to stage an event that is lively and informative, with stimulating keynote speakers, interactive breakout and concurrent sessions on timely topics, relevant roundtable discussions, and the ever-popular student panel, a talk show-style information session. 
 
Our program of speakers and panels for the 2008 Annual Symposium is exceptional. Here are a few examples of the sessions you will enjoy:
 
Forging Partnerships for Default Prevention
Justin Draeger, Assistant Director for Communication, NASFAA
Pending legislation will likely change the way default rates are measured and hold schools to new standards. This could open the door for the financial aid community to forge stronger relationships with schools to decrease the number of students in default.
 
Getting Ready, Getting In, and Getting Through College 
Dr. Ann Coles, Senior College Access Advisor, The Education Resources Institute
Explore financial aid strategies that your institution can implement to assist low-income students to prepare for, enroll in, and graduate from college.
 
Piecing Together the Student Success Puzzle
Jillian Kinzie, Associate Director, Center for Postsecondary Research &amp; NSSE Institute
With many moving parts, the keys to a student’s success can be a challenge. Jillian Kinzie shares her insight from her book, Piecing Together the Student Success Puzzle and reveals new ideas that you can take with you and implement on campus.

Working With Your High Risk Borrowers
Ann Brieck, M.A., Post Graduate Student Affairs and Financial Aid Consultant, Sense and Centsibility
This session aims to assist financial aid professionals in identifying and understanding their high-risk borrowers. Ann Brick also provides strategies and new approaches to connect with members of the Millennial Generation.
