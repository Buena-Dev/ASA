    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Consolidation
 
Come enjoy a discussion with the financial aid community on consolidation later this month.
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
I wanted to make you aware of a new series we’re kicking off for schools and our Strategic Lender Partners.  We understand the hectic and demanding days our school partners face, often making it difficult to keep up with the latest financial aid industry news.  So we’ve designed efficient half-day forums that ensure they won’t waste valuable time out of the office.  As part of our Partnership Dialogue Series, we’re proud to host an exchange between colleagues on the topic of consolidation.  This series will afford schools the opportunity to discuss, ask questions, and receive feedback on one of the hottest topics affecting lenders and financial aid offices around the country.  And as one of our Strategic Lender Partners, we’d like to invite you to join us on January 31, 2007 in Arlington, Virginia.
 
Our dialogue on consolidation will begin at 8:30 am, with the schools staying with us throughout the morning and into lunch.  We then invite you to stay after lunch to learn more about what ASA has to offer, why the guarantor you choose matters, and how we can help you promote ASA in the marketplace.
