    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 

Due to the inclement weather, American Student Assistance unfortunately has had to cancel our Partnership Dialogue Series scheduled to take place on February 7, 2007 in Dublin, OH.
 
We would like to first thank you for registering to attend this event and apologize for any inconvenience this cancellation may have caused.  We hope to reschedule at later date. 
 
Thanks again for your willingness to take time out of your busy schedule to join us; we look forward to seeing you at future events.
 
Sincerely,
