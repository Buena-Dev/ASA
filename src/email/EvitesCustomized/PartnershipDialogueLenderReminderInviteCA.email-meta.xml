    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
It&apos;s not too late for you to RSVP to participate in ASA&apos;s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication.
 


As part of our Partnership Dialogue Series, we’re proud to host an exchange among our colleagues in San Francisco, CA on February 21, 2008 and Santa Ana, CA on February 22, 2008. In this upcoming series, we will explore the challenges schools face in order to effectively communicate with students and families today. With the overwhelming array of media available, ranging from podcasts to phone calls and text messages, which methods do schools feel comfortable using? And which methods are the most effective for their millennial students and Baby Boomer parents? This series will encompass a broad discussion of the communication challenges schools face, the scope and message of their communication mission, what resources they need to succeed in that mission, and which outreach for experiments to students and families have yielded the best results. 

Our dialogue will begin at 9:00 a.m., with schools joining us for the morning session and lunch. After lunch, we look forward to speaking to you about what ASA has to offer, why the guarantor you choose matters, and how ASA and {!Account.Name} can work together in the marketplace.

8:30 – 9:00 a.m. Continental Breakfast
