    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication

 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Please accept this invitation to attend the second installment of our Partnership Dialogue Series.  In this series - A Focus on Communication - we provide attendees the opportunity to discuss, ask questions, and receive feedback on some hot topics affecting lenders and financial aid officers around the country.  As one of our lender partners, we hope you can join us at one of our events being held in two California locations next month.

In this upcoming series, we will explore the challenges schools face of effectively communicating with students and families today. This series will encompass a broad discussion of the communication challenges schools face, the scope and message of their communication mission, what resources they need to succeed in that mission, and which outreach experiments to students and families have yielded the best results. 

Our dialogue will begin at 9:00 a.m., with schools joining us for the morning session and lunch.  After lunch, we look forward to speaking to you about what ASA has to offer, why the guarantor you choose matters, and how ASA and {!Account.Name} we can work together in the marketplace.
