    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Consolidation
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
We know you’re busy.  We know your inbox and voicemail boxes are full.
 
That’s why we’ve designed efficient, half-day forums that ensure you won’t waste valuable time out of the office.
 
As part of our Partnership Dialogue Series, we’re proud to host exchanges among our colleagues this February. This series will afford you the opportunity to join in an interactive presentation on consolidation loans followed by small round table discussions.  Be educated, ask questions, and receive feedback from colleagues, lenders and American Student Assistance on one of the hottest topics affecting financial aid offices across the country.
 
Agenda:
  
08:30 – 09:00    Continental Breakfast
 
09:00 – 12:00    Discussion and Exchange of Ideas
 
12:00 – 01:00    Lunch
