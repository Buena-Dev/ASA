    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
It&apos;s not too late for you to RSVP to participate in ASA&apos;s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication.
 
As part of our Partnership Dialogue Series, we’re proud to host an exchange among our colleagues in Phoenix Arizona on February 26, 2008.  In this upcoming series, we will explore the challenges of effectively communicating with students and families today. With the overwhelming array of media available, ranging from podcasts to phone calls and text messages, which methods do you feel comfortable using? And which methods are the most effective for your millennial students and Baby Boomer parents? 
 
Our Partnership Dialogue Series will afford you the opportunity to join in an interactive presentation followed by round table discussions.  Be educated, ask questions, and receive feedback from colleagues American Student Assistance on one of the hottest topics affecting financial aid offices across the country.
