    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
It&apos;s not too late for you to RSVP to participate in ASA&apos;s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication.
 
As part of our Partnership Dialogue Series, we’re proud to host an exchange among our colleagues in  San Francisco, CA on February 21, 2008 and Santa Ana, CA on February 22, 2008. In this upcoming series, we will explore the challenges of effectively communicating with students and families today. With the overwhelming array of media available, ranging from podcasts to phone calls and text messages, which methods do you feel comfortable using? And which methods are the most effective for your millennial students and Baby Boomer parents? 
Be educated, ask questions, and receive feedback from colleagues, lenders and American Student Assistance on one of the hottest topics affecting financial aid offices across the country.
