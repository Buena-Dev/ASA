    <textOnly>ASA’s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication
 
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
It&apos;s not too late for you to RSVP to participate in ASA&apos;s Partnership Dialogue Series: A Focus on Communication.
 
In this upcoming series, on October 11, 2007 in College Park, MD, we will explore the challenges schools face in order to effectively communicate with students and families today. With the overwhelming array of media available, ranging from podcasts to phone calls and text messages, which methods do schools feel comfortable using? And which methods are the most effective for their millennial students and Baby Boomer parents? This series will encompass a broad discussion of the communication challenges schools face, the scope and message of their communication mission, what resources they need to succeed in that mission, and which outreach for experiments to students and families have yielded the best results. 

Our dialogue will begin at 9:00 a.m., with schools joining us for the morning session and lunch. After lunch, we look forward to speaking to you about what ASA has to offer, why the guarantor you choose matters, and how ASA and {!Account.Name} can work together in the marketplace. 

Proposed Agenda: 
8:30 – 9:00 a.m. Continental Breakfast (schools and lenders) 
9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. Discussion and Exchange of Ideas (schools and lenders)
